  summary: Request a pre-capture risk scan
  operationId: preCaptureRiskAssessment
  description: |
    Perform a pre-capture fraud assessment using your defined risk settings.<br><br> **Note**: If youâ€™ve already requested a pre-authentication fraud assessment for the transaction, provide the `assessment_id` returned in that response in your request to carry over the data. If you do include the `assessment_id`, the other fields you provide in this request will only fill in any gaps in the data; they will not overwrite any data.
